			My position as executive assistant involves consistent contact and collaboration with everyone in the company, often times the President, to accomplish office and offsite initiatives that our managers and president envision. I was solely responsible for updating the old WSSI website using code-based software, and worked with a small team of marketing professionals within the company to develop and launch the new website with a more user-friendly platform, and currently maintain several features of this new website. I also assist the Market Manager with RFP/RFQ responses by maintaining precise and professional communication with Prime Contractors and Subcontractors, and providing them with accurate and detailed information as requested for proposals.

			In addition to this specific experience, my general experience includes years of interpersonal and fast-paced multitasking skills in the fine dining industry. I also learned the ins and outs of running an environmentally-conscious organic home goods business during my internship at college.
			I believe that my business internship, hospitality experience, and the countless skills I acquired as a marketing assistant have greatly contributed to my ability to work in a fast-paced environment, learn new information and skills quickly and easily, and see and understand the big picture of any industry.
			My technical skills include proficiency in: Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Outlook, Excel, Powerpoint), Adobe Acrobat, Adobe PhotoShop, Adobe Dreamweaver CC, Constant Contact, and SquareSpace and Cosential.</p>
